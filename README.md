christmas_test
==============


Where to start :

Execute ./bin/graphical_editor.rb

Graphical editor displays all the vailable commands at start but you can see them at any time using LIST command

To exit use the command E.

Enjoy!

Feedback:
- The tests print extra output (menu). Please suppress it.
- you have two graphical_editor.rb files with almost identical content. Clearly you forgot to remove one of them, please be careful.
- The flood fill is likely to fail on 250x250 matrix because of a stack overflow but that isn't a huge problem.
- You might or might not get an interview at Forward with this code, depending on who'd be reviewing it. Number one comment would
  be "careless", followed by "doesn't follow Ruby conventions", which is a shame because I know you can do so much better :)
